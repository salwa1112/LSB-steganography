# LSB-steganography
This Describes the use of LSB Steganography.
STEGANOGRAPHY  comes  from  the  Greek  Words:  STEGANOS – 'Covered' and  GRAPHIE – 'Writing'.
The sender will hide their message in an image/audio/video. The algorithm uses the lease significant bit to hide the secret message and it can not be detected by human eye.
Steganalysis:
<p>Steganalysis is the process of detecting messages hidden using steganography. LSB Steganography can be find by looking at the histograms of the files.</p>

There are various types of steganography:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Image Steganography</li>
  <li>Audio  Steganography</li>
  <li>Video Steganography</li>
  <li>Text files Steganography</li>
  </ul>
<br>
Types of Images:
<ul>
  <li>Black and white</li>
  <li>RGB</li>
  <li>Geryscale</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in a gray scale image each pixel is represented in 8 bits. 
The last bit in a pixel is called as Least Significant bit as its value will affect the pixel value only by 1.
This property is used to hide the data in the image. If anyone have think of the last two bits as LSB bits as they will affect the pixel value only by 3</P>
The  LSB  embedding  approach  has become the basis of many techniques nowadays that hide messages within multimedia carrier data. 
LSB embedding may even be  applied in particular data domains, for example:  embedding a hidden  message  into  the  color  values  of  RGB bitmap data</p>
